# 🎯 Conversation Modes Guide

## Overview

LLMSider offers three distinct conversation modes, each optimized for different use cases. Choose the right mode to match your workflow and get the best results from AI assistance.

---

## 🗣️ Normal Mode

### What is Normal Mode?

**Direct, immediate AI conversation** - like chatting with a knowledgeable assistant.

```
You: What are the benefits of meditation?
AI: Meditation offers several benefits including reduced stress,
    improved focus, better emotional regulation, and enhanced
    self-awareness. Research shows...
```

### Characteristics

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Speed** | ⚡⚡⚡ Instant responses |
| **Complexity** | Simple to moderate tasks |
| **Control** | Minimal user intervention |
| **Tool Use** | Limited (user-initiated only) |
| **Best For** | Q&A, brainstorming, quick tasks |

### When to Use

**✅ Great For:**
- Quick questions and answers
- Brainstorming ideas
- Explaining concepts
- Generating drafts
- Casual conversation
- Learning new topics

**❌ Not Ideal For:**
- Complex multi-step tasks
- Tasks requiring tool execution
- Research requiring multiple sources
- File manipulation

### Example Workflows

#### 1. Quick Research
```
You: Summarize quantum computing in simple terms

AI: Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses quantum
    mechanics principles... [provides summary]
```

#### 2. Content Generation
```
You: Write a professional email template for meeting requests

AI: Subject: Meeting Request - [Topic]
    Dear [Name],
    I hope this message finds you well...
```

#### 3. Brainstorming
```
You: Give me 10 unique blog post ideas about productivity

AI: 1. The 2-Minute Rule: How Small Actions Lead to Big Results
    2. Digital Minimalism: Simplifying Your Tech Stack
    ...
```

## 🎯 Guided Mode

### What is Guided Mode?

**Interactive, step-by-step conversation with tool confirmation** - The AI suggests actions one at a time, and you approve them before execution.

```
You: Create a research note on machine learning

AI: I can help with that. First, I should create a file for the note.
    
    [Tool Suggestion]
    Tool: create_file
    Args: { path: "machine-learning.md", content: "# Machine Learning\n\n" }
    
    [Approve] [Reject]

You: [Approve]

AI: File created. Now, should I search for some key concepts to add?
```

### Characteristics

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Speed** | ⚡⚡ Moderate (requires approvals) |
| **Complexity** | Moderate to high |
| **Control** | ⭐⭐⭐ High user control |
| **Tool Use** | One-by-one with approval |
| **Best For** | Learning, complex tasks, safety |

### When to Use

**✅ Great For:**
- Tasks where you want full control
- Learning how the AI uses tools
- Sensitive file operations
- Ensuring accuracy at each step
- Collaborative problem solving

**❌ Not Ideal For:**
- Fully autonomous tasks
- Speed (Agent mode is faster)
- Simple Q&A (Normal mode is better)

### Workflow

1. **User Request**: You ask for something.
2. **AI Suggestion**: AI suggests a tool call or asks a clarifying question.
3. **User Action**: You approve the tool or answer the question.
4. **Execution**: Tool runs (if approved).
5. **Loop**: AI analyzes the result and suggests the next step.

### Example Workflows

#### 1. Controlled Research
```
You: Find information about the latest React version.

AI: I'll search for "React latest version release notes".
    [Tool: google_search]
    [Approve] [Reject]

You: Approve.

AI: Found React 19. Now I'll fetch the official blog post.
    [Tool: fetch_url]
    [Approve] [Reject]
```

#### 2. Safe File Editing
```
You: Refactor this file.

AI: I'll read the file first.
    [Tool: read_file]
    [Approve]

AI: I see the code. I'll apply the changes now.
    [Tool: edit_file]
    [Approve]
```

## 🤖 Agent Mode

### What is Agent Mode?

**Autonomous Plan & Execute** - The AI analyzes your request, generates a full plan (Sequential or DAG), and executes it automatically.

```
You: Research and compare top 5 programming languages

AI: [Plan Generated]
    1. Search for rankings (Parallel)
    2. Fetch details for Python (Parallel)
    3. Fetch details for JavaScript (Parallel)
    ...
    6. Create comparison report (Sequential)

    [Executing Step 1...]
    [Executing Step 2...]
    ...
    
    ✓ Task Complete!
```

### Characteristics

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Speed** | ⚡⚡⚡ Fast (no approval needed) |
| **Complexity** | High - handles anything |
| **Control** | ⭐ Low (autonomous) |
| **Tool Use** | Automatic with all tools |
| **Best For** | Research, automation, data |

### When to Use

**✅ Great For:**
- Research and data gathering
- Repetitive tasks
- Multi-tool workflows
- Comprehensive analysis
- Automation
- Time-saving operations

**❌ Not Ideal For:**
- Sensitive file operations
- Learning new workflows
- Tasks requiring human judgment
- Destructive operations

### Tool Execution

#### Execution Modes

Agent Mode supports two execution strategies (configurable in Settings):

1. **Sequential Mode (Default)**
   - Steps run one after another
   - Safer and easier to debug
   - Stops if a step fails

2. **DAG Mode (Parallel)**
   - Independent steps run simultaneously
   - Faster for complex tasks
   - Example: Searching 5 different topics at once

#### Automatic Tool Selection
```
Goal: "Create weekly report from project notes"

AI decides:
1. search_vault("project notes")      → Find relevant notes
2. read_file("meeting-notes.md")      → Read content
3. google_search("industry trends")   → Get context
4. create_file("weekly-report.md")    → Create report
5. edit_file(add_chart_data)          → Add visualizations
```

**Progress Indicators:**
```
[⏳] Searching vault... (search_vault)
[✓] Found 15 relevant notes
[⏳] Fetching web data... (google_search)
[✓] Retrieved industry trends

## 📝 Message Action Buttons

When you hover over a message, a set of action buttons appears. Different message types display different buttons.

### User Message Actions

When you hover over **messages you sent**:

| Button | Icon | Function | Use Case |
|--------|------|----------|----------|
| **Copy Message** | 📋 | Copy message content to clipboard | Quickly copy your prompt |
| **Edit Message** | ✏️ | Edit this message (deletes this and all subsequent messages) | Fix typos or refine your question |

**Note**: Editing a user message retracts that message and all subsequent conversation. The content will be placed back in the input box for you to modify.

---

### Assistant Message Actions

When you hover over **AI assistant responses**:

#### Basic Actions (Available in All Modes)

| **Generate New Note** | 📄 | Create a new note file from this response | Save AI answer as permanent note |
| **Insert at Cursor** | ↙️ | Insert content at current editor cursor | Quickly add response to your note |
| **Regenerate** | 🔄 | Delete this response and regenerate | Retry when unsatisfied with answer |
| **Compare with Other Models** | 🔀 | Add another model for comparison | See multiple models' answers side-by-side |

#### Advanced Actions (Guided/Normal Mode Only)

When the message contains **text modification suggestions** or **selected text context**, additional buttons appear:

| Button | Icon | Function | Use Case |
|--------|------|----------|----------|
| **Apply Changes** | ✅ | Apply AI's suggested modifications to original file | Accept AI's editing suggestions |
| **Toggle Diff View** | 👁️ | Switch between rendered and diff comparison views | Review before/after changes |

## 💡 Best Practices

### 🎯 Mode Selection Strategy

**Start with Normal, Escalate as Needed:**
```
Simple task → Normal
  ↓ (if tools needed)
Add complexity → Guided
  ↓ (if confident)
Full automation → Agent
```

**Task Checklist:**
```
□ Does it require tools?
  → No: Normal | Yes: Continue
□ Do I need to review each step?
  → Yes: Guided | No: Continue
□ Can AI decide autonomously?
  → Yes: Agent | No: Guided
```

### 🚀 Workflow Optimization

**Normal Mode Tips:**
1. Keep requests clear and specific
2. One task per message
3. Use follow-up questions
4. Reference previous context

**Guided Mode Tips:**
1. Review plan before approving
2. Modify steps if needed
3. Skip unnecessary steps
4. Learn the workflow

**Agent Mode Tips:**

2. Enable relevant tools only
3. Monitor progress
4. Stop if going off-track

### 🔒 Safety Guidelines

**Normal Mode:**
- ✅ Safe for all operations
- ✅ No automatic changes
- ✅ Full control

**Guided Mode:**
- ✅ Review before approval
